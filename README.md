## About

My name is **Brandon Gui**! I am a games developer and I like making games.

I also enjoy exploring coding topics outside of game development. Right now, I'm writing webpages and solving coding challenges!

Unfortunately, I won't have much time in doing what I like since in Singapore, we have [National Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_service_in_Singapore) and I still have a long way to go before I ORD. This might suck but I see it as an opportunity to learn new things and make new friends (in fact, I managed to meet 2 of them who are developers)!

Despite this, I squeeze in some coding time for myself whenever I'm free. This will at least make sure that I don't forget my coding knowledge. Speaking of free time, I also read developer news over at [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/).
